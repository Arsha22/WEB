<h2>Trees</h2>
<center>
<p>Trees are very important for life on earth. Without trees, the earth will become lifeless and dry. There would be no water, no rain, and no forests at all. Trees give us oxygen, shade, fruits and much more. They also serve as a home for nearly 10,000 species of birds. Trees form forests. Without trees, there would be no forests.  No forests mean no animals.
Without trees, the ecosystem of the planet will fall down. Trees also prevent floods and cause rain. In villages, people use the fallen branches of trees as fuel. We can only live along with trees. We canâ€™t live without them.</p>
